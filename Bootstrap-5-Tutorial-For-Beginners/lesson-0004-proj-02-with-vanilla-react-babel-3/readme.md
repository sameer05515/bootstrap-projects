Your observation is correct that **Babel Standalone**, by default, doesn't inherently resolve multiple files or their dependencies like a proper module bundler (e.g., Webpack, Vite, or Rollup) does. It works on a **per-file basis**, and this limitation is why it struggles with JSX components imported from other files in larger projects.

However, there are **workarounds** for transpiling multi-JSX file setups with Babel Standalone. Let me walk you through the concept and provide clear steps to achieve it.

### **Why Babel Standalone Doesn't Handle Multiple JSX Files**
Babel Standalone works in the browser and transpiles code dynamically. It treats each `<script>` tag as an independent entity. When `import` or `require` is encountered, Babel doesn't have the logic to resolve file paths, as it isn't designed as a module bundler.

In larger projects, bundlers like Webpack or Vite handle file resolution and dependency graphs for multiple files. But you can still achieve this manually by pre-loading files and transpiling them in sequence.

### **Workaround: How to Use Multiple JSX Files with Babel Standalone**

#### **Approach: Preload and Transpile Files**
Instead of letting Babel resolve file imports dynamically, you can manually load and transpile the dependent JSX files in the correct sequence.

Here's how you can do it:

---

#### **Example: Multi-JSX Setup**

##### **1. File Structure**
```
index.html
App.js
Component1.js
Component2.js
```

##### **2. `Component1.js`**
```javascript
export const Component1 = () => {
  return <h2>Component 1</h2>;
};
```

##### **3. `Component2.js`**
```javascript
export const Component2 = () => {
  return <h2>Component 2</h2>;
};
```

##### **4. `App.js`**
```javascript
import { Component1 } from "./Component1.js";
import { Component2 } from "./Component2.js";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from App</h1>
      <Component1 />
      <Component2 />
    </div>
  );
};
```

##### **5. `index.html`**
Hereâ€™s the setup to manually load, transpile, and use the components:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Multi-JSX with Babel</title>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.19.3/babel.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Helper function to fetch and transpile a file
    async function fetchAndTranspile(file) {
      const response = await fetch(file);
      const code = await response.text();
      return Babel.transform(code, {
        presets: ["react"],
        plugins: ["transform-modules-umd"],
      }).code;
    }

    // Load dependencies in sequence
    (async () => {
      // Transpile Component1
      const component1Code = await fetchAndTranspile("Component1.js");
      eval(component1Code); // Load it into the browser's context

      // Transpile Component2
      const component2Code = await fetchAndTranspile("Component2.js");
      eval(component2Code); // Load it into the browser's context

      // Transpile App
      const appCode = await fetchAndTranspile("App.js");
      eval(appCode); // Load it into the browser's context

      // Render App to the DOM
      ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
        React.createElement(App)
      );
    })();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### **Explanation of the Setup**

1. **`fetchAndTranspile()` Function**:
   - Fetches a `.js` file via its URL.
   - Uses Babel Standalone to transpile the code to browser-compatible JavaScript.
   - Returns the transpiled code as a string.

2. **`eval()` to Load Transpiled Code**:
   - `eval()` is used to execute the transpiled code and register the components (e.g., `Component1`, `Component2`, `App`) in the global scope.

3. **Loading Files Sequentially**:
   - Files are loaded in the correct order: first dependencies (`Component1` and `Component2`), then the main file (`App.js`).

4. **Rendering the Component**:
   - Once all dependencies are loaded and transpiled, you can render the `App` component to the DOM using `ReactDOM.createRoot()`.

---

### **Important Notes**

- **Performance**: This approach is only suitable for learning or small-scale projects. Fetching and transpiling files in the browser is not efficient for production.
  
- **Security Warning**: Using `eval()` is generally discouraged as it can open up security vulnerabilities. In this case, it's used for simplicity in a controlled learning environment.

- **Alternative for Larger Projects**: If you're working on a larger project, you should use a bundler like Webpack, Vite, or Parcel to precompile your JSX files and resolve dependencies efficiently.

---

### **Conclusion**
Yes, it is possible to use multiple JSX files with Babel Standalone using this manual file loading and transpilation approach. However, for production-ready solutions or more complex setups, switching to a proper development environment with a bundler is highly recommended. Let me know if you'd like help setting that up!
